3D Portfolio Website for Video Editor built with AI


Prepare Your Assets:
Compress and optimize your video files (.mp4 with H.264 codec is widely supported). Consider providing .webm as a fallback.
Create thumbnail images for each video project (.jpg or .png). Keep resolution reasonable (e.g., 800x450 pixels for a 16:9 screen display).
Place these files in the public/videos and public/thumbnails folders respectively. R3F/React will serve them directly.
(Optional) If you use 3D models for the environment or frames, place them in public/models. Use optimized formats like .glb.
Deployment:
Build your React app: npm run build
This creates a build folder with all static files.
Deploy the contents of the build folder to a static hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, or host them on your own server.
Key Considerations & Refinements:

Performance:
Asset Optimization: Reduce the poly count of 3D models, use low-resolution textures where appropriate.
Video Performance: Optimize your video files for web playback.
Scene Complexity: Start with a simple 3D scene.
Loading: Implement loading screens and lazy loading for assets.
Responsiveness: Ensure your UI is responsive, particularly for mobile devices. Use CSS media queries and test on multiple screen sizes.
Mobile Experience: Optimize for touchscreens. Consider simplifying the 3D scene or providing alternative controls on mobile.
Browser Support: Test on various browsers.
User Experience: Provide clear navigation and intuitive interactions.
Iterate and Improve: Continuously refine your design and functionality. Experiment with different approaches to find what works best.
This detailed guide gives you the foundation to create a unique and impactful 3D portfolio. The use of React Three Fiber makes the Three.js integration much more manageable, allowing you to focus on the creative aspects of your portfolio and less on the low-level 3D code. Good luck!

About & Contact Overlays (src/components/AboutOverlay.js, src/components/ContactOverlay.js):
These components are similar to the video player overlay, utilizing absolute/fixed positioning for a consistent look. Add content with a close button.
Header Component (src/components/Header.js):
A basic header component with your name/logo and navigation links to the "About" and "Contact" sections. Pass openAbout and openContact functions from App.
Loading Screen (src/components/LoadingScreen.js):
Displays a "Loading..." message or progress indicator. This appears before the 3D scene loads. Use the isLoading state in App.js to control it.

Project Setup:
Use Create React App or Vite to set up a new React project.
Install dependencies: react, react-dom, @react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei (drei provides helpful abstractions like camera controls, loaders, etc.).
npx create-react-app my-video-portfolio --template basic (or using Vite: npm create vite@latest my-video-portfolio --template react)
cd my-video-portfolio
npm install @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei
